# Credit-Explainer
**Credit-Explainer.ipynb** is the name of the main piece of code in this repository.

It contains the start-to-finish analysis of training and testing a Random Forest classifier on 10-feature credit data to predict delinquency within 2 years, as well as applying the LIME interpretability package on the result in order to allow the user to determine his or her creditworthiness according to the Random Forest model and suggest most relevant steps to correct any issues. 

Also in this repository is the **couples-LIME** folder. It contains a succinct tutorial of applying LIME to another Random Forest application.
