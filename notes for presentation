Interrtability allows us to explain decisinos without sacrificing accuracy. It supports decision making by giving us insight into indiv cases while the entire model rtemains as accurate as possible

M-A because used for models that are not convex (can be reduced to a minimum)
	able to explore latent space around each decision in a way that is convex


LASSO and FairML

Thank you for taking the time to meet with us today.

We are fellows from Insight Data Science, a program that helps individuals transition into careers as data scientists.

We're here because we are especially excited about the possibility of joining your team.

We've built these progjects in 3 weeks using a combination of Python and SQL, and our sites are hosted on AWS.

We'll each speak for 5 minutes to show you our work, and then we'll have time for questions after each presentation.
